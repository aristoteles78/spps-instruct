String functions
====================
With CLEM, you can run operations to compare strings, create strings, or access characters.

In CLEM, a string is any sequence of characters between matching double quotation marks ("string quotes"). Characters (CHAR) can be any single alphanumeric character. They're declared in CLEM expressions using single back quotes in the form of `<character>`, such as `z`, `A`, or `2`. Characters that are out-of-bounds or negative indices to a string will result in undefined behavior.
## Table 1. CLEM string functions
| Function                   | Result  | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| allbutfirst(N, STRING)                | String   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed.                                                                                                            |
| allbutlast(N, STRING)               | String    | Returns a string, which is STRING with the last characters removed.                                                                                                 |
| alphabefore(STRING1, STRING2)                | Boolean    | Used to check the alphabetical ordering of strings. Returns true if STRING1 precedes STRING2.                                                                                                              |
| count_substring(STRING, SUBSTRING)               | Integer    | Returns the number of times the specified substring occurs within the string. For example, count_substring("foooo.txt", "oo") returns 3.                                                                                                   |
| endstring(LENGTH, STRING)               | String    | Extracts the last N characters from the specified string. If the string length is less than or equal to the specified length, then it is unchanged.                                                                                                          |
| hasendstring(STRING, SUBSTRING)     | Integer    | This function is the same as isendstring(SUBSTRING, STRING). |
| hasmidstring(STRING, SUBSTRING)               | Integer    | This function is the same as ismidstring(SUBSTRING, STRING) (embedded substring).                                                                                                |
| hasstartstring(STRING, SUBSTRING)                   | Integer    | This function is the same as isstartstring(SUBSTRING, STRING).                                                                                                               |
| hassubstring(STRING, N, SUBSTRING)                  | Integer    | This function is the same as issubstring(SUBSTRING, N, STRING), where N defaults to 1.                                                                                                    |
| hassubstring(STRING, SUBSTRING)                         | Integer    | This function is the same as issubstring(SUBSTRING, 1, STRING), where N defaults to 1.                                                                                                     |
| isalphacode(CHAR)                   | Boolean   | Returns a value of true if CHAR is a character in the specified string (often a field name) whose character code is a letter. Otherwise, this function returns a value of 0. For example, isalphacode(produce_num(1)).                                                                                                               |
| isendstring(SUBSTRING, STRING)                 | Integer   | If the string STRING ends with the substring SUBSTRING, then this function returns the integer subscript of SUBSTRING in STRING. Otherwise, this function returns a value of 0.                                                                                                      |
| islowercode(CHAR)                   | Boolean    | Returns a value of true if CHAR is a lowercase letter character for the specified string (often a field name). Otherwise, this function returns a value of 0. For example, both islowercode(``) and islowercode(country_name(2)) are valid expressions.                                                                                                              |
| ismidstring(SUBSTRING, STRING)                 | Integer    | If SUBSTRING is a substring of STRING but does not start on the first character of STRING or end on the last, then this function returns the subscript at which the substring starts. Otherwise, this function returns a value of 0.                                                                                                  |
| isnumbercode(CHAR)                | Boolean   | Returns a value of true if CHAR for the specified string (often a field name) is a character whose character code is a digit. Otherwise, this function returns a value of 0. For example, isnumbercode(product_id(2)).     
| isstartstring(SUBSTRING, STRING)                | Integer   | If the string STRING starts with the substring SUBSTRING, then this function returns the subscript 1. Otherwise, this function returns a value of 0.     
| issubstring(SUBSTRING, N, STRING)                | Integer   | Searches the string STRING, starting from its Nth character, for a substring equal to the string SUBSTRING. If found, this function returns the integer subscript at which the matching substring begins. Otherwise, this function returns a value of 0. If N is not given, this function defaults to 1.    
| issubstring(SUBSTRING, STRING)                | Integer   | Searches the string STRING. If found, this function returns the integer subscript at which the matching substring begins. Otherwise, this function returns a value of 0.     
| issubstring_count(SUBSTRING, N, STRING)                | Integer   | Returns the index of the Nth occurrence of SUBSTRING within the specified STRING. If there are fewer than N occurrences of SUBSTRING, 0 is returned.     
| issubstring_lim(SUBSTRING, N, STARTLIM, ENDLIM, STRING)                | Integer   | This function is the same as issubstring, but the match is constrained to start on STARTLIM and to end on ENDLIM. The STARTLIM or ENDLIM constraints may be disabled by supplying a value of false for either argumentâ€”for example, issubstring_lim(SUBSTRING, N, false, false, STRING) is the same as issubstring.     
| isuppercode(CHAR)                | Boolean   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed.     
| allbutfirst(N, STRING)                | String   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed.     
| allbutfirst(N, STRING)                | Integer   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed.     
| allbutfirst(N, STRING)                | String   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed.     
| allbutfirst(N, STRING)                | String   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed. 
| allbutfirst(N, STRING)                | String   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed.     
| allbutfirst(N, STRING)                | String   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed.     
| allbutfirst(N, STRING)                | String   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed.     
| allbutfirst(N, STRING)                | String   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed.     
| allbutfirst(N, STRING)                | String   | Returns a string, which is STRING with the first N characters removed.
