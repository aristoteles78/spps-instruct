# Special fields

Special functions are used to denote the specific fields under examination, or to generate a list of fields as input.

For example, when deriving multiple fields at once, you should use @FIELD to denote perform this derive action on the selected fields. Using the expression log(@FIELD) derives a new log field for each selected field.

| `@FIELD`                      | Any    | Performs an action on all fields specified in the expression context.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `@TARGET`                     | Any    | When a CLEM expression is used in a user-defined analysis function, `@TARGET` represents the target field or "correct value" for the target/predicted pair being analyzed. This function is commonly used in an Analysis node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `@PREDICTED`                  | Any    | When a CLEM expression is used in a user-defined analysis function, `@PREDICTED` represents the predicted value for the target/predicted pair being analyzed. This function is commonly used in an Analysis node.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `@PARTITION_FIELD`            | Any    | Substitutes the name of the current partition field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `@TRAINING_PARTITION`         | Any    | Returns the value of the current training partition. For example, to select training records using a Select node, use the CLEM expression: `@PARTITION_FIELD = @TRAINING_PARTITION`. This ensures that the Select node will always work regardless of which values are used to represent each partition in the data.                                                                                                                                      |
| `@TESTING_PARTITION`          | Any    | Returns the value of the current testing partition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `@VALIDATION_PARTITION`       | Any    | Returns the value of the current validation partition.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `@FIELDS_BETWEEN(start, end)` | Any    | Returns the list of field names between the specified start and end fields (inclusive) based on the natural (that is, insert) order of the fields in the data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `@FIELDS_MATCHING(pattern)`   | Any    | Returns a list of field names matching a specified pattern. A question mark (?) can be included in the pattern to match exactly one character; an asterisk (\*) matches zero or more characters. To match a literal question mark or asterisk (rather than using these as wildcards), a backslash (\) can be used as an escape character. Note: This requires a string literal as an argument; it can't use a nested expression to generate the argument. |
| `@MULTI_RESPONSE_SET`         | Any    | Returns the list of fields in the named multiple response set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
